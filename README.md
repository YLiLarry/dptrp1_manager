# dptrp1manager

A python package to provide high level tools to work with the Sony DPT-RP1.
This relies heavily on the [https://github.com/janten/dpt-rp1-py](dpt-rp1-py)
package and all credit goes to its author.


## Install

To install the library run `python3 setup.py install` or `pip3 install .` from
the root directory. To install as a developer use `python3 setup.py develop`
(see [the setuptools
docs](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode))
and work on the source as usual.
